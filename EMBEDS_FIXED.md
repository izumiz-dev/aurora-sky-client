# Embeds Fix Summary

## The Problem
Images, quote posts, URL previews, and YouTube embeds were not displaying in the Bluesky client.

## Root Cause
The embed data structure returned by the Bluesky API uses view formats with different $type values and structures than the input formats:

1. **View Types**: API returns `app.bsky.embed.record#view` instead of just `app.bsky.embed.record`
2. **Different Structure**: View formats have different property structures (e.g., direct URLs instead of blob references)
3. **Nested Data**: Quote posts and record with media have nested structures

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated Type Checking in RichContent.tsx
- Added checks for both input and view formats (e.g., `app.bsky.embed.record` OR `app.bsky.embed.record#view`)
- Fixed data extraction logic to handle the actual API response structure

### 2. Fixed Image Handling in ImageViewer.tsx
- Updated to handle both direct URL strings (view format) and blob references (input format)
- Prioritized fullsize URLs over thumbnails

### 3. Fixed External Embed Handling
- Updated to handle both string URLs and blob references for thumbnails
- Fixed YouTube embed detection and rendering

### 4. Fixed Quote Post Handling
- Updated to handle the ViewRecord structure from API responses
- Fixed nested record extraction for recordWithMedia embeds

### 5. Updated Sample Data
- Converted all sample embeds to use the correct view format structure
- Matches what the actual API returns

## Testing
Created a test page at `/test-embeds` to verify all embed types render correctly.

## Key Learnings
1. AT Protocol has different schemas for input (creation) and output (viewing) of embeds
2. View formats include additional metadata and use direct URLs instead of blob references
3. Proper type checking needs to handle both format variations
